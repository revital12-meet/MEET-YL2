The app looks great! I know you had a lot of problems getting the sensing / accelerometer to work, but I am extremely happy with how it turned out. The movement is not perfect, as you know, but it is good enough to make the game fun to play. The one bug I could find was that when you get the ball to the end (which took me a long time, by the way =P), there is nothing that pops up saying “Good game” or “You finished” or doesn’t even restart the game to the beginning. There is a text box in the top right corner that says “Game Over”, but then it can immediately switch back to “Game-ON” if the phone moves a little bit. My recommendation for how to deal with this is to have a pop-up menu saying “Game over. Do you want to play again?” and if the answer is Yes, resetting the moving ball back to the start. I know this is yet another thing to have to implement after all the pain you went through to make this work, but it would add a nice touch. And as you know, there is always something to make the app better.

I like the design because it is clean and easy to use (and the ability to add custom pictures to the background is also cool). As soon as I open the app, I know exactly what I am supposed to do. 

Great job with this app - you should be super proud of yourself for getting this done. I’m definitely proud of you.
