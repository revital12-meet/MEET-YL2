a. In order to run the server, I typed "python manage.py runserver". The URL I went to is "http://127.0.0.1:8000".

b. After clicking on the first movie, the URL is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/1/".
After clicking on the second movie, the URL is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/2/".
If I added 100 movie, its URL will be "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/100/".

c. If you type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/addmovie" it calls the function "views.add_movie" in vies.py.
If you type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/5/" it calls the function "views.movie".
If I type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shrek" in the browser there will be an error because there isn't a regular expression in the urls.py that fits this expression.

3) d. Because it sends it to urls.py, which directs it to the right function in views.py (add_comment).
